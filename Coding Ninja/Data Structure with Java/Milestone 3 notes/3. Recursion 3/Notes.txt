#TIP-1
-Returning in a problem and printing in a problem is quite different
-keep in mind you cannot return the value of a smaller output to the larger output
-To tackle this problem you can keep an argument in the function which always carries itself with the value of smaller output
-Use this argument to perform operations and again pass the updated value of the argument for next bigger output
Ex- printing a factorial instead of returning
#TIP-2
-If we print questions like subsequences which do not contains singular calculation but multiple choices for getting smaller output,
we need to carry a argument of stringSoFar, which will just contain the currently passed subsequence and when any base case arrives,
it prints that stringSoFar subsequence
-We need to call the function mutiple times depending upon the choices we need to take to get the smaller output
Ex- In subsequence question - To calculate subsequence, we have two choices, either to take the current charater or ignore it
  - These two choices will lead to calling of function two times with one calling taking current charater and other ignoring the 
    current character
#TIP-3
-Remember -> returning = bottom-up while printing = top down
