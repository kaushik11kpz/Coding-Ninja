Introduction to Recursion
-In recursion, a function calls itself but with a smaller input value

Recursion and PMI
-Actual Math in recursion
-Recursion is based on mathematical concept PMI(Principal of Mathematical Induction)
-Example
-To prove f is true for all natural number
Task 1 - prove f(0) & f(1) is true
Assume - f(k) is true
Task 2 - prove f(k+1) is true

Problem Solving through recursion
-Task 1
Find base case - Ex - 0!=1 , 1!=1
-Task 2
Induction hypothesis(Assumption) - Ex - Assume upto f(n-1), function will work
-Task 3
-Induction Step - Ex -  Find factoral of f(n) using f(n-1)


Print First N natural numbers

Fibonacci Numbers
--Task 1
Find base case - Ex - 0!=1 , 1!=1
-Task 2
Induction hypothesis(Assumption) - Ex - Assume upto f(n-1) and <=f(n-1), function will work
-For every input, two previous numbers solution is required
-Task 3
-Induction Step - Ex -  Find factoral of f(n) using f(n-1)


Use recursion in problems related to array
-Check if array is sorted
-Sum of Array
-Check number in Array
-First Index of Number in Array
-Last Index of number in Array
